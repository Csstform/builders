# Tower Tetris - Physics Stacking Game

A strategic physics-based Tetris game where you stack tetrominoes to build the tallest tower possible. Lose a life when pieces fall off the platform, and aim for the highest score based on your tower's height!

## üéÆ How to Play

### Objective
Build the tallest tower possible by stacking tetrominoes on a small platform. You have 3 lives - lose one each time a piece falls off the platform.

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move pieces left/right (full steps)
- **A/D Keys**: Move pieces left/right (half steps for precision)
- **R or ‚Üë**: Rotate pieces
- **Space**: Drop pieces faster
- **Touch Controls**: Use on-screen buttons or swipe gestures on mobile

### Scoring
- **Final Score**: Based on tower height (100 points per block height)
- **Height Tracking**: Real-time display of current tower height
- **Life System**: 3 lives - game ends when all are lost

## üöÄ Features

### Current Features
- **Physics-Based Gameplay**: Realistic physics using Matter.js engine
- **7 Tetromino Types**: I, O, T, S, Z, J, L pieces with unique colors
- **Strategic Controls**: Full and half-step movement for precision
- **Dynamic Camera**: Automatically follows tower height for infinite building
- **Smart Spawning**: Collision detection prevents overlapping pieces
- **Stable Physics**: Balanced friction and damping for natural tower building
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Visual Polish**: Modern UI with glassmorphism effects

### Game Mechanics
- **Small Platform**: 200px wide platform with side gaps for challenge
- **No Bouncing**: Pieces stick immediately upon landing
- **Collision Detection**: Immediate next piece spawning when pieces land
- **Fall Detection**: All pieces (current and previous) count towards life loss
- **Camera Following**: Smooth camera movement when tower reaches 300px height

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Built With
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For game rendering
- **Matter.js**: Physics engine for realistic interactions
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, pure JS implementation
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with glassmorphism and responsive design
